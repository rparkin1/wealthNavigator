## Step 2: Create Your First Goal (2 minutes)

### Start a New Conversation
1. Click **"New Conversation"** in the sidebar
2. The AI assistant will greet you

### Define Your Retirement Goal
Simply tell the AI what you want:

```
"I want to retire at age 65 with $80,000 per year in retirement income."
```

The AI will ask clarifying questions like:
- Current age?
- Current savings?
- Monthly contribution amount?
- Risk tolerance?

**Example Conversation:**
```
You: I want to retire at age 65 with $80,000 per year.

AI: Great! Let me help you plan for retirement. A few questions:
    1. What's your current age?
    2. How much do you currently have saved?
    3. How much can you contribute monthly?

You: I'm 35, have $50,000 saved, and can contribute $2,000/month.

AI: Perfect! I'm analyzing your retirement plan now...
```

### Review Your Goal
The AI will create a structured goal with:
- **Target Amount**: $2,000,000 (calculated)
- **Time Horizon**: 30 years
- **Monthly Savings**: $2,000
- **Success Probability**: To be calculated

‚úÖ **Your goal is created!**

---

## Step 3: Get Your Portfolio Recommendation (1 minute)

The AI will automatically:

### 1. Analyze Your Profile
- Age: 35
- Time horizon: 30 years
- Risk tolerance: Moderate (inferred from age)

### 2. Recommend Optimal Allocation
Example recommendation:
```
Recommended Portfolio Allocation:
- 70% Stocks (US & International)
- 25% Bonds
- 5% Cash

Expected Annual Return: 8.0%
Risk (Volatility): 15%
```

### 3. Show Efficient Frontier
You'll see a chart showing:
- Your optimal portfolio (marked with a star)
- Other possible allocations
- Risk vs. return trade-offs

‚úÖ **You have a personalized portfolio!**

---

## Step 4: Run Monte Carlo Simulation (1 minute)

### What is Monte Carlo Simulation?
Instead of one projection, we run **5,000 different scenarios** to account for market ups and downs. This gives you a realistic success probability.

### Run the Simulation
The AI will automatically run the simulation:

```
Running Monte Carlo simulation...
- Iterations: 5,000
- Time: ~5 seconds
- Scenarios: Market boom, crash, average, etc.
```

### Understand Your Results

**Success Probability: 87%**
```
Interpretation:
‚úÖ In 87% of scenarios, you reach your $2M goal
‚ùå In 13% of scenarios, you fall short

Percentile Projections:
- 90th percentile: $3.2M (best case)
- 50th percentile: $2.1M (median)
- 10th percentile: $1.4M (worst case)
```

### Fan Chart Visualization
You'll see a chart showing:
- **Green zone**: Best outcomes (90th percentile)
- **Yellow zone**: Median outcomes (50th percentile)
- **Red zone**: Worst outcomes (10th percentile)
- **Your goal line**: $2M target

‚úÖ **You know your success probability!**

## üéâ Congratulations!

You've completed the quick start! Here's what you accomplished:

1. ‚úÖ Created your first retirement goal
2. ‚úÖ Got a personalized portfolio recommendation
3. ‚úÖ Ran a Monte Carlo simulation
4. ‚úÖ Understood your 87% success probability

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Improve Your Plan
If your success probability is below 90%, try:
- **Increase contributions**: Even $100/month makes a difference
- **Extend timeline**: Work 1-2 years longer
- **Reduce goal**: Lower retirement spending
- **Adjust allocation**: Take slightly more risk

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Start Conservative
Begin with a moderate risk tolerance. You can always adjust later.

### 2. Update Regularly
Review your plan every 3-6 months and update:
- Contribution amounts
- Goal targets
- Risk tolerance

### 3. Use Scenarios
Try "what-if" scenarios:
- "What if I save $500 more per month?"
- "What if I retire at 67 instead of 65?"
- "What if returns are lower than expected?"

### 4. Don't Panic
Low success probability? That's normal for aggressive goals. The AI will help you adjust.

## üÜò Stuck? Common Issues

### "My success probability is too low"
**Solutions:**
- Increase monthly contributions
- Extend retirement age
- Lower retirement spending goal
- Increase risk tolerance slightly

### "I don't know my risk tolerance"
**Use this guide:**
- **Conservative**: Age 55+ or need certainty
- **Moderate**: Age 35-55, balanced approach
- **Aggressive**: Age 20-35, long time horizon

### "The simulation results seem volatile"
**This is normal!** Markets are volatile. The simulation shows realistic scenarios, not just best-case.

### "I want to change my goal"
Just tell the AI:
```
"I want to update my retirement goal to $90,000 per year"
```
The AI will recalculate everything.
