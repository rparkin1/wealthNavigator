## Getting Started

### What is WealthNavigator AI?

WealthNavigator AI is an intelligent financial planning platform that helps you:

- **Plan for major life goals** (retirement, education, home purchase)
- **Optimize your investment portfolio** using Modern Portfolio Theory
- **Understand success probability** through Monte Carlo simulation
- **Make tax-efficient decisions** with AI-powered recommendations
- **Track your progress** toward your financial goals

### Key Concepts

**Goals**: Specific financial objectives with target amounts and dates (e.g., "Retire at 65 with $70,000/year")

**Portfolio**: Your investment allocation across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.)

**Monte Carlo Simulation**: A statistical method that runs thousands of scenarios to estimate the probability of achieving your goals

**Multi-Agent System**: 8 specialized AI agents that work together to analyze your finances from different perspectives

## Creating Your First Goal

### Step 1: Start a New Conversation

1. Click the **"New Thread"** button in the sidebar
2. The chat interface will open with a welcome message
3. You'll see the AI agents activate automatically

### Step 2: Describe Your Goal in Natural Language

Simply type what you want to achieve. Here are some examples:

**Retirement Goal:**
```
I want to retire at 60 with $80,000 per year in retirement income
```

**Education Goal:**
```
I need to save $150,000 for my child's college in 10 years
```

**Home Purchase:**
```
I want to save $100,000 for a down payment in 5 years
```

### Step 3: Provide Your Financial Information

The AI will ask you questions to understand your situation:

- **Current age and retirement age**
- **Current income and expenses**
- **Existing savings and investments**
- **Risk tolerance** (conservative, moderate, aggressive)
- **Time horizon** (when you need the money)

### Step 4: Review Your Goal Summary

The AI will summarize your goal and show:

- **Target amount** needed
- **Timeline** to achieve it
- **Required monthly savings**
- **Success probability** (preliminary estimate)

## Understanding Your Portfolio

### Portfolio Allocation

After defining your goal, the Portfolio Architect Agent will recommend an optimal allocation:

**Example Allocation:**
```
- US Stocks: 50%
- International Stocks: 20%
- Bonds: 25%
- Cash: 5%
```

### What You'll See

1. **Pie Chart**: Visual representation of your allocation
2. **Risk Metrics**:
   - Expected return (annual percentage)
   - Volatility (standard deviation)
   - Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted return)
3. **Efficient Frontier**: Shows the optimal risk/return trade-off

### How Recommendations Are Made

The Portfolio Architect uses:

- **Modern Portfolio Theory** (Markowitz optimization)
- **Your risk tolerance** and time horizon
- **Capital Market Assumptions** (expected returns for each asset class)
- **Diversification principles** to reduce portfolio risk

### Customizing Your Portfolio

You can adjust the recommendation by telling the AI:

```
I want a more conservative portfolio
```

or

```
I don't want any international stocks
```

## Running Simulations

### What is a Monte Carlo Simulation?

A Monte Carlo simulation runs thousands of scenarios (typically 5,000+) to estimate how your portfolio might perform over time based on:

- **Historical market volatility**
- **Your contributions** (monthly savings)
- **Expected returns** for your asset allocation
- **Random market fluctuations** (sequence of returns risk)

### Starting a Simulation

Simply ask:

```
Run a Monte Carlo simulation for my retirement goal
```

### What Happens Next

1. **Setup**: The AI configures simulation parameters
2. **Progress**: You'll see a progress bar (typically 10-30 seconds)
3. **Results**: Statistical analysis of 5,000+ scenarios

### Interpreting Results

**Success Probability:**
```
Your retirement goal has a 78% probability of success
```

This means in 78 out of 100 scenarios, your portfolio grew enough to meet your goal.

**Percentile Projections:**

- **10th Percentile**: Worst 10% of outcomes (bear market scenarios)
- **50th Percentile**: Median outcome (most likely)
- **90th Percentile**: Best 10% of outcomes (bull market scenarios)

### Fan Chart Visualization

The fan chart shows:

- **X-axis**: Years until your goal
- **Y-axis**: Portfolio value
- **Colored bands**: Different probability ranges
- **Your target**: Horizontal line showing required amount

---

## Analyzing Results

### Success Metrics

**Goal Funding Status:**
- **On Track** (>80% success probability): You're likely to meet your goal
- **At Risk** (60-80% probability): May need adjustments
- **Off Track** (<60% probability): Requires significant changes

### What-If Scenarios

Ask the AI to explore alternatives:

```
What if I save an extra $200 per month?
```

```
What happens if I retire at 62 instead of 60?
```

```
How does delaying Social Security affect my success rate?
```

### Recommendations

The AI agents will suggest improvements:

- **Increase savings rate** by specific amount
- **Adjust retirement age** to improve probability
- **Modify asset allocation** for better risk/return
- **Consider tax strategies** to keep more of your returns

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific About Your Goals

**❌ Vague:** "I want to save for retirement"

**✅ Specific:** "I want to retire at 65 with $70,000 per year in today's dollars"

### 2. Provide Accurate Financial Information

- Use actual numbers from your bank/brokerage statements
- Include all sources of income and expenses
- Don't forget irregular expenses (insurance, property tax)

### 3. Review Assumptions

The AI makes assumptions about:

- **Inflation** (typically 2-3%)
- **Investment returns** (based on historical data)
- **Tax rates** (current law)

Make sure these align with your expectations.

### 4. Run Multiple Scenarios

Don't rely on a single plan. Explore:

- **Best case**: Higher savings, better returns
- **Base case**: Realistic expectations
- **Worst case**: Lower returns, unexpected expenses

### 5. Update Regularly

Your plan should evolve as your life changes:

- **Annually**: Review and update your goals
- **Major life events**: Marriage, children, job change
- **Market changes**: Significant bull or bear markets

### 6. Understand Limitations

WealthNavigator AI:

- ✅ Provides **educational analysis** and projections
- ✅ Uses **institutional-grade** calculation tools
- ❌ Does **not** provide personalized financial advice
- ❌ Cannot **predict** future market performance

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is WealthNavigator AI a robo-advisor?**

A: Not exactly. We're a goal-based planning platform with AI agents. We help you plan and analyze, but we don't execute trades or manage your accounts directly.

**Q: How much does it cost?**

A: Currently in beta (free). Post-beta pricing will be announced.

**Q: Is my data secure?**

A: Yes. We use bank-level encryption (TLS 1.3, AES-256) and never store your account credentials. See our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).

### Goal Planning

**Q: Can I have multiple goals?**

A: In the MVP (current version), you can define one primary goal (typically retirement). Multi-goal planning will be available in Phase 2.

**Q: What if I already have savings?**

A: Tell the AI your current portfolio value, and it will factor that into your projections.

**Q: Can I include Social Security?**

A: Yes! The Retirement Planner Agent includes Social Security in retirement income calculations.

### Portfolio Questions

**Q: Why is my recommended allocation different from what I expected?**

A: The Portfolio Architect optimizes based on Modern Portfolio Theory, your risk tolerance, and time horizon. It may differ from traditional "rules of thumb."

**Q: Can I exclude certain investments?**

A: Yes. Tell the AI about any preferences or restrictions (e.g., "no international stocks" or "ESG investments only").

**Q: How often should I rebalance?**

A: The AI will recommend rebalancing when your allocation drifts more than 5% from targets, typically annually or semi-annually.

### Simulation Questions

**Q: Why does my success probability change?**

A: Success probability can change based on:
- Time horizon (longer = more uncertainty)
- Risk tolerance (higher risk = more volatility)
- Required savings rate
- Market assumptions

**Q: Is 70% success probability good enough?**

A: It depends on the goal:
- **Essential goals** (retirement): Target 85-90%
- **Important goals** (education): 75-85% may be acceptable
- **Aspirational goals**: 60-70% can be reasonable

**Q: What if my success rate is low?**

A: The AI will suggest adjustments:
1. Increase monthly savings
2. Adjust timeline (retire later, delay goal)
3. Modify target amount
4. Take on slightly more investment risk
