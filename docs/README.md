## 💡 Key Concepts

### Goal-Based Planning
Every investment is connected to a specific goal. This "mental accounting" approach helps you:
- Stay focused on what matters
- Make better investment decisions
- Track progress toward specific objectives
- Adjust strategies for different time horizons

### Monte Carlo Simulation
Instead of relying on a single projection, we run thousands of scenarios (5,000+) to calculate the probability of reaching your goals. This accounts for market volatility and uncertainty.

### Modern Portfolio Theory
We use Nobel Prize-winning portfolio theory to build efficient portfolios that maximize expected return for your risk tolerance.

### Tax-Aware Optimization
We consider tax implications when:
- Placing assets in different account types
- Rebalancing your portfolio
- Planning withdrawals in retirement
- Harvesting tax losses
