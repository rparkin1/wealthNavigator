## How It Works

### User Query Flow

```
User: "Should I harvest any tax losses in my portfolio?"

↓

Orchestrator Agent
  - Detects keywords: "harvest", "tax losses"
  - Routes to: advanced_portfolio

↓

Advanced Portfolio Agent
  - Analyzes query intent
  - Selects tools: tax_loss_harvesting
  - Fetches current holdings
  - Runs wash sale detection
  - Identifies replacement securities
  - Calculates tax benefits
  - Generates AI recommendations

↓

Visualization Agent
  - Creates charts showing opportunities
  - Displays tax benefit estimates
  - Shows replacement options
  - Presents actionable recommendations

↓

User receives comprehensive analysis with:
  ✓ Specific securities to sell
  ✓ Exact loss amounts
  ✓ Tax savings estimate
  ✓ Replacement securities
  ✓ Execution timeline
```

### Multi-Engine Analysis

The agent can run multiple analyses in a single query:

```
User: "Give me a complete portfolio analysis"

→ Runs ALL three engines in parallel:
  1. Tax-loss harvesting opportunities
  2. Rebalancing needs assessment
  3. Historical performance tracking

→ Synthesizes results into unified recommendations
```

## Technical Architecture

### Agent Decision Logic

```python
# From advanced_portfolio_agent.py:51-79

query_lower = user_query.lower()

if any(word in query_lower for word in
    ["tax loss", "harvest", "tlh", "tax efficient"]):
    analysis_types.append("tax_loss_harvesting")

if any(word in query_lower for word in
    ["rebalance", "drift", "allocation", "adjust"]):
    analysis_types.append("rebalancing")

if any(word in query_lower for word in
    ["performance", "return", "track", "benchmark"]):
    analysis_types.append("performance")

# Default to comprehensive analysis if no specific request
if not analysis_types:
    analysis_types = ["performance", "rebalancing"]
```

### Tool Orchestration

```python
# From advanced_portfolio_agent.py:122-203

# Tax-Loss Harvesting
if "tax_loss_harvesting" in analysis_types:
    tlh_strategy = await identify_tax_loss_harvesting_opportunities(
        holdings=sample_holdings,
        recent_transactions=recent_transactions,
        tax_rate=tax_rate,
        min_loss_threshold=100.0
    )
    # Process and store results

# Rebalancing
if "rebalancing" in analysis_types and portfolio_allocation:
    rebalancing_strategy = await generate_rebalancing_strategy(
        target_allocation=target_allocation,
        current_holdings=current_holdings,
        account_breakdown=account_breakdown,
        drift_threshold=5.0,
        tax_rate=tax_rate
    )
    # Process and store results

# Performance Tracking
if "performance" in analysis_types:
    performance_report = await generate_performance_report(
        portfolio_id=thread_id,
        historical_values=values,
        asset_class_returns=asset_class_returns,
        asset_weights=asset_weights
    )
    # Process and store results
```

### LangGraph Routing

```python
# From graph.py:29-38

agent_routing = {
    "goal_planner": "goal_planner",
    "portfolio_architect": "portfolio_architect",
    "monte_carlo_simulator": "monte_carlo",
    "advanced_portfolio": "advanced_portfolio",  # NEW!
    "visualization": "visualization",
}

# From graph.py:72-77
if "advanced_portfolio" in remaining:
    return "advanced_portfolio"
elif "monte_carlo_simulator" in remaining:
    return "monte_carlo"
else:
    return "visualization"
```

## Financial Concepts Implemented

### 1. Tax-Loss Harvesting

**Theory**: Sell securities at a loss to offset capital gains, reducing tax liability.

**Implementation**:
- Scans all holdings for unrealized losses
- Checks 30-day wash sale window
- Finds 95-99% correlated replacements
- Calculates priority scores (0-100)
- Estimates tax benefits

**Example**:
```
Holding: SPY (-$3,000 unrealized loss)
Tax Rate: 24%
Tax Benefit: $720
Replacement: VTI (98% correlation)
Recommendation: SELL & REPLACE
Priority: 87/100
```

### 2. Portfolio Rebalancing

**Theory**: Maintain target asset allocation by adjusting holdings that have drifted.

**Implementation**:
- Calculates drift from target allocation
- Classifies severity (low/medium/high/critical)
- Generates tax-aware trades
- Prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts
- Provides alternative strategies

**Example**:
```
Asset Class: US Large Cap
Target: 45%
Current: 52%
Drift: +7% (CRITICAL)
Action: SELL $10,500 in taxable account
Estimated Tax: $756
Alternative: Direct new contributions to underweight assets
```

### 3. Performance Tracking

**Theory**: Measure portfolio returns and risk-adjusted performance vs. benchmarks.

**Implementation**:
- Calculates returns across multiple periods
- Computes risk metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar)
- Benchmarks against indices
- Attributes performance to asset classes
- Identifies outliers and trends

**Example**:
```
Period: YTD
Total Return: +12.3%
Sharpe Ratio: 1.42
Max Drawdown: -8.7%
Alpha vs S&P 500: +2.1%
Beta: 0.95
Top Contributor: US Tech (+3.8%)
```

## Expected Benefits

### Quantified Value Add

1. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: 0.7-1.5% annual alpha
   - $100k portfolio → $700-$1,500/year in tax savings
   - Compounds over time with reinvestment

2. **Tax-Aware Rebalancing**: 0.2-0.5% annual alpha
   - Minimizes tax drag
   - Maintains optimal risk/return profile

3. **Performance Attribution**: Informational value
   - Identifies underperforming asset classes
   - Guides allocation adjustments
   - Improves decision-making

### Total Annual Alpha: 0.9-2.0%

For a $100,000 portfolio, this represents **$900-$2,000 per year** in additional value.

For a $1,000,000 portfolio: **$9,000-$20,000 per year**
