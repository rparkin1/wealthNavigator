### Feature 3: Pattern Analysis

**What It Does**:
Analyzes budget entries to detect patterns and provide insights.

**Analysis Areas**:

1. **Recurring Pattern Detection**:
   - Is this a recurring entry?
   - What's the typical frequency?
   - Are there seasonal variations?

2. **Fixed vs Variable Classification**:
   - Does the amount stay consistent?
   - What's the variability level?
   - Are fluctuations predictable?

3. **Category Verification**:
   - Is the category accurate?
   - Alternative categories to consider?
   - Confidence level?

4. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Is the amount within normal range?
   - Red flags (unusually high/low)?
   - Should this be reviewed?

5. **Optimization Suggestions**:
   - Potential savings opportunities
   - Better tracking methods
   - Related expenses to group

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "is_recurring": true,
  "typical_frequency": "monthly",
  "is_fixed": true,
  "variability": "low",
  "category_confidence": 0.95,
  "is_anomalous": false,
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider setting up automatic payment",
    "This is a fixed expense - include in baseline budget",
    "Typical range for this category: $1,800-$2,400"
  ]
}
```

### Backend AI Integration

**Step 1: Initialize AI Tools**
```python
from app.tools.budget_ai_tools import BudgetAITools
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

# Create LLM instance
llm = ChatAnthropic(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    temperature=0.3,
)

# Initialize AI tools
budget_ai = BudgetAITools(llm)
```

**Step 2: Extract Budget from Conversation**
```python
conversation = """
User: I make $8,000 per month from my job at the tech company.
My rent is $2,200 a month, and I spend about $600 on groceries.
I contribute $1,000 to my 401k every month, and I spend around
$150 on utilities. My car payment is $450 monthly.
"""

# Extract entries
entries = budget_ai.extract_budget_from_conversation(conversation)

# Result:
# [
#   {
#     "category": "salary",
#     "name": "Monthly salary from tech company",
#     "amount": 8000,
#     "frequency": "monthly",
#     "type": "income",
#     "is_fixed": true,
#     "confidence": 0.95
#   },
#   {
#     "category": "housing",
#     "name": "Monthly rent",
#     "amount": 2200,
#     "frequency": "monthly",
#     "type": "expense",
#     "is_fixed": true,
#     "confidence": 1.0
#   },
#   # ... more entries
# ]
```

**Step 3: Categorize New Entry**
```python
# User adds an entry manually
entry_description = "Netflix premium subscription"

# Categorize it
result = budget_ai.categorize_entry(entry_description, amount=15.99)

# Result:
# {
#   "category": "subscriptions",
#   "confidence": 1.0,
#   "note": "Streaming service subscription"
# }
```

**Step 4: Analyze Patterns**
```python
# Analyze an entry
analysis = budget_ai.analyze_pattern(
    entry_name="Monthly rent",
    amount=2200,
    frequency="monthly",
    category="housing"
)

# Result:
# {
#   "is_recurring": true,
#   "typical_frequency": "monthly",
#   "is_fixed": true,
#   "variability": "low",
#   "category_confidence": 1.0,
#   "is_anomalous": false,
#   "suggestions": [
#     "This is a fixed expense - set up automatic payment",
#     "Consider renter's insurance if not included"
#   ]
# }
```

**Step 5: Generate Smart Suggestions**
```python
# Get smart recommendations
suggestions = budget_ai.generate_smart_suggestions(entries)

# Result:
# {
#   "health_score": 82,
#   "health_category": "good",
#   "savings_rate": 17.5,
#   "concerns": [
#     "Savings rate slightly below 20% target",
#     "Housing costs are 31% of income (slightly high)"
#   ],
#   "opportunities": [...],
#   "recommendations": [...]
# }
```

## 4. AI Prompts & Tools

### Extraction System Prompt

The AI uses a comprehensive system prompt that defines:

1. **Income Detection Rules**: 21 income categories
2. **Expense Detection Rules**: 20 expense categories
3. **Savings Detection Rules**: 6 savings categories
4. **Frequency Detection**: 6 frequency types
5. **Fixed vs Variable Logic**: Classification criteria
6. **Amount Parsing**: Handle $, k, ranges, approximations
7. **Confidence Scoring**: 5-level confidence system
8. **Edge Case Handling**: Ambiguity resolution

### Categorization Logic

Categories are matched using:
- **Keyword matching**: "rent" → housing
- **Context analysis**: "monthly payment for apartment" → housing
- **Amount heuristics**: $2,200/month → likely rent
- **Pattern recognition**: "Netflix" → subscriptions

### Pattern Recognition

Patterns are identified through:
- **Historical data analysis**: Compare to typical ranges
- **Variability calculation**: Standard deviation from mean
- **Frequency detection**: Recurring vs one-time
- **Seasonality**: Month-over-month changes
- **Anomaly scoring**: Z-score for outliers

## 5. Integration Examples

### Example 1: Chat-Based Budget Entry

**User Interaction**:
```
User: "I just got a raise! I now make $9,500 per month."
