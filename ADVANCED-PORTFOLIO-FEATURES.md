## 📚 What Was Built

### 1. Tax-Loss Harvesting Engine (`tax_loss_harvester.py` - 600+ lines)

**Purpose**: Automate tax-loss harvesting to capture tax savings while maintaining portfolio exposure

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Wash sale rule detection (30-day window)
- ✅ Replacement security matching (95%+ similarity)
- ✅ Priority scoring algorithm
- ✅ Multi-security tracking
- ✅ Tax benefit calculations
- ✅ Execution order optimization

**Core Functionality**:

```python
async def identify_tax_loss_harvesting_opportunities(
    holdings: List[Holding],
    recent_transactions: List[Transaction],
    tax_rate: float = 0.24,
    min_loss_threshold: float = 100.0
) -> TaxLossHarvestingStrategy
```

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "total_harvestable_losses": 4500.00,
  "total_tax_benefit": 1080.00,
  "opportunities": [
    {
      "security": "SPY",
      "loss": 3000.00,
      "tax_benefit": 720.00,
      "wash_sale_risk": true,
      "wash_sale_window_end": "2024-10-15",
      "priority_score": 65.5,
      "recommendation": "⚠️ WAIT: Wash sale risk until 2024-10-15",
      "replacements": [
        {"ticker": "VTI", "similarity": 95, "tracking_diff": 0.002},
        {"ticker": "IVV", "similarity": 99, "tracking_diff": 0.0001}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Replacement Security Matrix**:
- SPY ↔ VTI, IVV, SCHX (95-99% correlation)
- QQQ ↔ ONEQ, QQQM, QQEW (85-99% correlation)
- AGG ↔ BND, IUSB, SCHZ (96-98% correlation)
- VEA ↔ IEFA, SCHF, EFA (95-98% correlation)
- VWO ↔ IEMG, SCHE, EEM (94-97% correlation)

**Tax Benefit Estimation**:
```python
annual_tlh_benefit = portfolio_value * alpha

# Alpha calculation:
base_alpha = 0.005  # 0.5% baseline
vol_multiplier = volatility / 0.15  # Higher vol = more opportunities
freq_multiplier = rebalancing_frequency / 12  # Monthly checks = 1.5x
tax_multiplier = tax_rate / 0.24

total_alpha = base_alpha * vol_multiplier * freq_multiplier * tax_multiplier
# Typical range: 0.5-1.5% annually
```

### 2. Portfolio Rebalancing Engine (`rebalancer.py` - 450+ lines)

**Purpose**: Maintain target allocation while minimizing tax impact

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Drift analysis (percentage and dollar)
- ✅ Tax-aware trade sequencing
- ✅ Account type optimization (taxable vs. tax-deferred)
- ✅ Threshold-based triggers
- ✅ Cost-benefit analysis
- ✅ Alternative strategies (use new contributions)

**Core Functionality**:

```python
async def generate_rebalancing_strategy(
    target_allocation: Dict[str, float],
    current_holdings: Dict[str, float],
    account_breakdown: Dict[AccountType, Dict[str, float]],
    drift_threshold: float = 5.0,
    tax_rate: float = 0.24
) -> RebalancingStrategy
```

**Drift Severity Classification**:
- **Low**: <2.5% drift from target
- **Medium**: 2.5-5% drift
- **High**: 5-10% drift
- **Critical**: >10% drift (immediate action)

**Tax Optimization Strategy**:
1. **Tax-advantaged accounts first**: Trade in IRA/401(k) before taxable
2. **Sell losses before gains**: Minimize tax in taxable accounts
3. **Use new contributions**: Avoid selling when possible
4. **Threshold rebalancing**: Only rebalance when drift >5%

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "needs_rebalancing": true,
  "max_drift": 7.2,
  "estimated_tax_cost": 450.00,
  "trades": [
    {
      "account": "tax_deferred",
      "asset": "US_LargeCap",
      "action": "sell",
      "amount": 5000,
      "tax_impact": 0.00,
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "account": "tax_exempt",
      "asset": "Bonds",
      "action": "buy",
      "amount": 5000,
      "tax_impact": 0.00,
      "priority": 2
    }
  ],
  "alternative_strategy": "Direct new contributions to underweight positions",
  "execution_notes": "Execute trades in tax-advantaged accounts first"
}
```

**Rebalancing Frequency Benefits**:
| Frequency | Trades/Year | Alpha | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Annual | 1 | 0.0% | Baseline |
| Quarterly | 4 | +0.15% | Good balance |
| Monthly | 12 | +0.25% | Higher costs |
| Threshold (5%) | ~3 | +0.20% | **Optimal** ✅ |

- ✅ Risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar)
- ✅ Benchmark comparison (alpha, beta, tracking error)
- ✅ Performance attribution by asset class
- ✅ Risk metrics (VaR, max drawdown, correlation)
- ✅ Up/down capture ratios

**Core Functionality**:

async def generate_performance_report(
    portfolio_id: str,
    historical_values: Dict[str, float],
    asset_class_returns: Dict[str, Dict[str, float]],
    asset_weights: Dict[str, float],
    benchmark_returns: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None
) -> PerformanceReport
```

**Example Response**:
```
🎯 Advanced Portfolio Analysis

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Your portfolio has 2 significant tax-loss harvesting opportunities
totaling $4,500 in losses ($1,080 tax benefit). Your allocation has
drifted 7.2% from target, suggesting rebalancing is recommended.

TOP 3 PRIORITY ACTIONS:
1. Harvest $3,000 loss in SPY after Oct 15 (avoid wash sale)
   → Replace with VTI (99% correlation, 0.01% tracking error)
   → Tax benefit: $720

2. Rebalance US Large Cap (52% → 45% target)
   → Sell $10,500 from tax-deferred IRA (no tax)
   → Estimated cost: $0 (tax-free account)

3. Review quarterly performance (Sharpe: 0.54, up-capture: 105%)
   → Outperforming benchmark by 1.8% with less downside risk

EXPECTED BENEFITS:
- Tax savings: $1,080 annually from TLH
- Risk reduction: 7.2% drift → 0% (back to target)
- Alpha preservation: Maintain 1.8% excess return

TIMELINE:
- Wait 15 days for wash sale window
- Execute TLH trades on Oct 16-17
- Rebalance in tax-advantaged accounts immediately
- Review performance monthly

RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS:
⚠️ Tracking error with replacement securities (<0.01%)
⚠️ Transaction costs (~$10-20 per trade)
✅ No tax impact if executed in IRA first
✅ High-priority opportunities (score: 65-85/100)
```

## 🎓 Technical Deep Dive

### Tax-Loss Harvesting Algorithm

**1. Loss Identification**:
```python
for holding in holdings:
    unrealized_loss = cost_basis - current_value
    if unrealized_loss >= min_threshold:
        # Potential TLH opportunity
```

**2. Wash Sale Detection**:
```python
def check_wash_sale_window(sale_date, purchase_date, window=30):
    days_diff = abs((sale_date - purchase_date).days)
    return days_diff <= window  # True = violation
```

**3. Replacement Matching**:
```python
# Correlation matrix for similar securities
SPY ↔ VTI: 95% (broad vs. S&P 500)
SPY ↔ IVV: 99% (same index, different provider)

# Select highest similarity that's NOT substantially identical
```

**4. Priority Scoring**:
```python
priority_score = (
    tax_benefit_score(0-40 pts) +
    loss_percentage_score(0-30 pts) +
    wash_sale_penalty(-20 pts if risky) +
    tracking_error_penalty(0 to -10 pts)
)
# Range: 0-100, higher = execute first
```

### Rebalancing Optimization

**1. Drift Calculation**:
```python
drift_pct = (current_weight - target_weight) * 100
drift_dollars = drift_pct * total_portfolio_value

severity = {
    abs(drift) < 2.5: "low",
    abs(drift) < 5.0: "medium",
    abs(drift) < 10.0: "high",
    abs(drift) >= 10.0: "critical"
}
```

**2. Tax-Aware Trade Sequencing**:
```python
# Priority order:
1. Tax-deferred accounts (IRA, 401k) - no tax impact
2. Tax-exempt accounts (Roth) - no tax impact
3. Taxable accounts - minimize capital gains

# Within taxable:
1. Sell losses first (harvest tax benefit)
2. Sell long-term gains (lower rate)
3. Avoid short-term gains (higher rate)
```

**3. Alternative Strategies**:
```python
if new_contributions > 0:
    # Instead of selling overweight:
    contribution_allocation = {
        asset: contribution * target_weight
        for asset in underweight_positions
    }
    # Avoids all tax costs!
```

### Performance Calculations

**1. Sharpe Ratio**:
```python
sharpe = (mean_return - risk_free_rate) / std_deviation
# Annualized: sharpe * sqrt(252)  # Trading days
```

**2. Sortino Ratio**:
```python
downside_returns = returns[returns < target_return]
downside_dev = std(downside_returns)
sortino = (mean_return - target) / downside_dev
# Penalizes only downside volatility
```

**3. Maximum Drawdown**:
```python
running_max = cumulative_max(returns)
drawdowns = (current_value - running_max) / running_max
max_drawdown = min(drawdowns)  # Most negative
```

**4. Beta Calculation**:
```python
beta = covariance(portfolio_returns, market_returns) / variance(market_returns)
# <1.0: Less volatile than market
# 1.0: Same as market
# >1.0: More volatile than market
```
