## Test Execution Examples

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Watch Mode (Development)
```bash
npm test
# Vitest will watch for file changes and re-run tests
```

```bash
npm run test:ui
# Opens browser-based test UI
```

### Coverage Report
```bash
npm run test:coverage
# Generates coverage report in coverage/
```

---

## Continuous Integration

### CI/CD Integration

**Recommended:**
- Run tests on every PR
- Block merges if tests fail
- Generate coverage reports
- Track coverage trends

**GitHub Actions Example:**
```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  run: npm test -- --run
- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update Tests

1. **Component Changes:**
   - Props added/removed
   - User interactions modified
   - Rendering logic updated

2. **Hook Changes:**
   - State management updated
   - Side effects added
   - Event handlers modified

3. **Service Changes:**
   - API methods added
   - Event types changed
   - Error handling updated

### Test Hygiene

- ✅ Keep tests fast (<100ms each)
- ✅ Use descriptive test names
- ✅ One assertion per test (when possible)
- ✅ Clean up resources (mocks, timers)
- ✅ Avoid test interdependencies
