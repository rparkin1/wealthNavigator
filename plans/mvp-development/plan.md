# WealthNavigator AI: MVP Development Plan

## Spec

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of WealthNavigator AI will be a functional, single-user, web-based application that allows users to perform basic, goal-oriented financial planning. The user will be able to engage in a conversation with an AI assistant to define a single financial goal (focused on retirement), receive a basic portfolio allocation, and see a simple projection of their plan's success. The application will feature a clean, intuitive interface for managing these conversations and viewing the results. The core of the MVP is to validate the conversational AI planning experience and the basic financial modeling.

## Plan

My approach is to build the application from the ground up, starting with the foundational elements and progressively adding the core MVP features. I will begin by setting up the project structure and necessary dependencies for a React/TypeScript frontend and a Python/FastAPI backend. I will then implement the conversation management system with local storage persistence. Following that, I will develop the core financial planning agents and tools, starting with a simple goal planner and portfolio optimizer. Finally, I will integrate these components and build the user interface for displaying the results, including basic charts and projections.

## Tasks

- [ ] **Project Setup**: Initialize a new project with a React/TypeScript frontend and a Python/FastAPI backend.
- [ ] **Conversation Management**:
    - [ ] Implement UUID-based conversation threads.
    - [ ] Persist conversation history to LocalStorage.
    - [ ] Create the basic UI for displaying and navigating conversation threads.
- [ ] **Core Financial Agents (Backend)**:
    - [ ] Develop a basic `Goal Planner Agent` that can understand a single retirement goal from natural language.
    - [ ] Create a simple `Portfolio Architect Agent` that suggests a portfolio from 3-5 asset classes.
    - [ ] Implement a basic `Monte Carlo Simulator Agent` for projections.
- [ ] **API Development**:
    - [ ] Create FastAPI endpoints for managing threads and streaming AI responses.
    - [ ] Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication.
- [ ] **Frontend Development**:
    - [ ] Build the main chat interface for user interaction.
    - [ ] Develop UI components to display portfolio allocations and simulation results.
    - [ ] Implement basic data visualizations (e.g., pie chart for allocation).
- [ ] **Integration & Testing**:
    - [ ] Integrate the frontend with the backend API.
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the core calculation logic.
    - [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing of the MVP user flow.

## Context

- **/ProductDescription/PRD.md**: This is the main source of truth for the project's requirements. It outlines all features, including the MVP scope (Phase 1). I will refer to this for the core functionalities like conversation management, goal-based planning, and the Monte Carlo simulation.
- **/ProductDescription/api-specification.md**: This document details the API endpoints that need to be implemented. I will use this as a guide for building the FastAPI backend and for the frontend to consume the API.
- **/ProductDescription/user-stories.md**: These user stories provide a user-centric view of the features. I will use the stories under the "MVP" epics to guide the development of the user interface and ensure the application meets user needs.
- **/ProductDescription/PROJECT-SUMMARY.md**: This file provides a high-level overview and confirms the MVP scope, ensuring my plan aligns with the project's phased release strategy.
