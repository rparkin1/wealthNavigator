This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**WealthNavigator AI** is a goal-based financial planning and portfolio management platform that combines conversational AI with institutional-grade wealth management tools. The platform uses a multi-agent architecture to help users plan for retirement, education funding, home purchases, and other major financial goals.

**Current Status:** Planning phase with comprehensive documentation. Implementation not yet started.

## Core Architecture

### Multi-Agent System
The platform uses 8 specialized AI agents coordinated by an orchestrator:
- **Budgeting Agent** - Cash flow analysis and expense categorization
- **Goal Planner Agent** - Goal structuring and funding calculations
- **Portfolio Architect Agent** - Modern Portfolio Theory optimization
- **Tax Strategist Agent** - Asset location and tax-loss harvesting
- **Risk Manager Agent** - Risk assessment and hedging strategies
- **Retirement Planner Agent** - Retirement income and withdrawal modeling
- **Monte Carlo Simulator Agent** - Probabilistic simulations (5,000+ iterations)
- **Visualization Agent** - React-based charts and dashboards

### Technology Stack

**Frontend (Planned):**
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- State: Zustand (global), React Query (server)
- UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Charts: Recharts + D3.js
- Streaming: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Storage: LocalStorage (versioned schemas), IndexedDB (large datasets)

**Backend (Planned):**
- Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- AI: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 via LangChain
- Database: PostgreSQL (user data), Redis (cache)
- Queue: RabbitMQ (async tasks)
- Calculations: NumPy/SciPy (portfolio optimization), custom Monte Carlo engine

**External Services:**
- Plaid - Account aggregation
- Alpha Vantage/Yahoo Finance - Market data
- IRS API - Tax tables

## Key Product Concepts

### Thread-Based Conversations
- UUID-based conversation threads for organizing planning sessions
- LocalStorage persistence with auto-save every 5 seconds
- Automatic categorization: "Today," "Yesterday," "Past 7 Days," etc.
- Max 100 active threads per user
- Soft delete with 30-day recovery

### Goal-Based Planning
- Natural language goal creation: "I want to retire at 60 with $80,000 per year"
- Categories: Retirement, Education, Home Purchase, Major Expense, Emergency Fund, Legacy
- Priority levels: Essential, Important, Aspirational
- Success probability thresholds (e.g., "90% confidence for retirement")
- Mental accounting: separate allocation per goal

### Portfolio Optimization
- Mean-variance optimization for efficient frontier
- 50+ asset classes supported
- Multi-level optimization: Goal-level, Account-level, Household-level
- Time-based glide paths (reduce risk as goals approach)
- Tax-aware rebalancing

### Tax Optimization
- **Asset Location:** Tax-inefficient assets → tax-deferred accounts, growth assets → Roth
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting:** Daily monitoring with wash sale compliance
- **Withdrawal Sequencing:** Multi-account optimization, RMD planning, Roth conversions
- **Tax Projections:** Multi-year forecasting, IRMAA threshold management

### Monte Carlo Simulations
- 5,000+ iterations in <30 seconds (requirement)
- Success probability per goal
- Portfolio value distributions at percentiles
- Sequence of returns risk modeling
- Interactive what-if scenarios with instant recalculation

### Query-Based Analysis History
- Each analysis generates unique query ID
- Results linked to specific planning questions
- Categorization: Portfolio Analysis, Goal Planning, Tax Strategy, Risk Assessment
- Side-by-side scenario comparison
- Full export functionality

## Implementation Requirements

### Performance Targets
- Dashboard load: <1 second
- Thread list render: <100ms
- Account sync: <10 seconds
- Portfolio optimization: <5 seconds
- Monte Carlo simulation: <30 seconds
- Chart generation: <500ms
- Search results: <200ms

### Error Handling Strategy
- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- SSE stream interruption recovery with resume capability
- Component-level error boundaries with graceful fallback UI
- Context-aware error messages for financial operations
- Progress preservation during errors

### Financial-Specific Error Scenarios
- Market data unavailable → Use cached data with disclaimer
- Portfolio optimization fails → Suggest simplified allocation
- Monte Carlo timeout → Return partial results with note
- Bank connection lost → Queue sync for retry
- Tax calculation error → Flag for manual review

## Backend Tool Structure (When Implementing)

```python
# backend/tools/
portfolio_optimizer.py   # MPT optimization, efficient frontier
monte_carlo_engine.py    # Simulation engine (5,000+ iterations)
tax_calculator.py        # Asset location, harvesting, withdrawal sequencing
goal_analyzer.py         # Goal structuring, funding calculations
risk_assessor.py         # VaR, Sharpe, beta, stress testing
market_data.py          # Market data fetching and caching

# Tools are PRE-BUILT. Agents import and use them directly.
# Example:
from tools.portfolio_optimizer import optimize_portfolio
result = await optimize_portfolio({
    "goalIds": goal_ids,
    "riskTolerance": 0.6,
    "timeHorizon": 15
})
```

## Financial Planning Concepts

### Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
- Mean-variance optimization for efficient frontier calculation
- Risk-return trade-off analysis
- Rebalancing with tax-aware execution
- Multi-level optimization (Goal, Account, Household)

### Tax-Aware Strategies
- **Asset Location:** Place tax-inefficient assets (bonds, REITs) in tax-deferred accounts
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting:** Sell losses to offset gains, avoid wash sales (30-day rule)
- **Withdrawal Sequencing:** Optimize order of account withdrawals to minimize lifetime taxes
- **Roth Conversions:** Convert traditional IRA to Roth in low-income years

### Risk Management
- **Diversification:** Correlation matrix, concentration risk, sector/geographic exposure
- **Hedging:** Protective puts, collar strategies, inverse ETFs, tail risk hedging
- **Risk Metrics:** VaR (95%, 99%), Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, max drawdown

### Monte Carlo Methodology
- Simulate 5,000+ market scenarios using historical return distributions
- Model portfolio value over time with contributions, withdrawals, and market volatility
- Calculate success probability (% of scenarios meeting goal)
- Sequence of returns risk: early losses have bigger impact than later losses

## Security & Compliance

**Data Security:**
- End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3)
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Multi-factor authentication required
- OAuth tokens for account access (never store credentials)

**Regulatory:**
