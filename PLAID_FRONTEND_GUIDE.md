# Plaid Frontend Integration Guide

## Overview

A complete frontend implementation for Plaid bank account integration has been created. This includes components for connecting accounts, viewing balances, managing transactions, and tracking investment holdings.

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. TypeScript Types (`frontend/src/types/plaid.ts`)
Complete type definitions for:
- PlaidItem (institution connections)
- PlaidAccount (bank/investment accounts)
- PlaidTransaction (transaction history)
- PlaidHolding (investment securities)
- API request/response types

### 2. API Service (`frontend/src/services/plaidApi.ts`)
Full API client with methods for:
- `createLinkToken()` - Initialize Plaid Link
- `exchangePublicToken()` - Convert public token to access token
- `listItems()` - Get connected institutions
- `removeItem()` - Disconnect institution
- `listAccounts()` - Get accounts with filtering
- `syncAccounts()` - Sync account balances
- `syncTransactions()` - Sync transactions incrementally
- `listTransactions()` - List with filters/pagination
- `updateTransaction()` - Update category/notes/exclusion
- `syncHoldings()` - Sync investment holdings
- `listHoldings()` - Get investment holdings

### 3. Components

#### PlaidDashboard (`frontend/src/components/plaid/PlaidDashboard.tsx`)
Main dashboard with tabbed interface:
- Accounts tab
- Transactions tab
- Investments tab
- "Connect Bank Account" button

#### InvestmentHoldings (`frontend/src/components/plaid/InvestmentHoldings.tsx`)
Shows:
- Investment accounts with holdings
- Ticker symbols and security names
- Quantity, price, market value
- Cost basis and gain/loss
- Percentage gain/loss

### 4. Navigation
Added to App.tsx:
- New "Bank Connections" menu item (🏦 icon)

- Lazy loading for performance

## 🚀 How to Use

     - MFA: `1234`
   - Accounts and transactions sync automatically

3. **View Accounts**
   - See all connected accounts
   - View balances by institution
   - Click "Sync All" to refresh
   - Click "Disconnect" to remove institution

4. **Manage Transactions**

## 🎨 UI Design

### Color Scheme
- Primary: Blue (#3B82F6)

- Mobile-friendly (planned)

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Base URL
Set in environment variable:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### User ID
For development, uses test user:
```typescript
localStorage.getItem('user_id') || 'test-user-123'
```

In production, replace with actual authenticated user ID.

## 🔌 Integration Points

### With Budget System
Transactions can be:
- Categorized for budget tracking
- Excluded from budgets
- Linked to budget categories

### With Portfolio System
Investment holdings can be:
- Imported into portfolio optimizer
- Used for asset allocation
- Tracked for performance

### With Goals System
Account balances can be:

- Used for progress tracking
- Included in net worth calculations

## 🐛 Error Handling

All components handle:
- Network errors (retry button)
- API errors (display error message)
- Empty states (helpful prompts)
- Loading states (spinner/skeleton)
- Invalid data (fallbacks)

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of components
- Pagination for large datasets
- Efficient re-rendering with React
- Debounced search (if needed)
- Conditional rendering based on data
