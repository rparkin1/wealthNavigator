## Key Technical Details

### Lazy Loading Implementation
All major data input views are lazy loaded for performance:
```typescript
const GoalsManager = lazy(() =>
  import('./components/goals/GoalsManager').then(m => ({ default: m.GoalsManager }))
);

const PortfolioDataManager = lazy(() =>
  import('./components/portfolio/PortfolioDataManager').then(m => ({ default: m.PortfolioDataManager }))
);

const UserSettings = lazy(() =>
  import('./components/settings/UserSettings').then(m => ({ default: m.UserSettings }))
);
```

### Risk Tolerance Implementation Details
```typescript
// Value stored as 0.0 - 1.0 internally
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  riskTolerance: '0.5',  // 50% = Moderate-Conservative
  taxRate: '0.24',       // 24% federal rate
});

// Slider uses 0-100 for better UX
<input
  type="range"
  value={parseFloat(formData.riskTolerance) * 100}
  onChange={(e) => setFormData({
    ...formData,
    riskTolerance: (parseFloat(e.target.value) / 100).toString()
  })}
  min="0"
  max="100"
  step="1"
/>

// Labels are calculated dynamically
const getRiskToleranceLabel = (value: number): string => {
  if (value < 0.25) return 'Conservative';
  if (value < 0.5) return 'Moderate-Conservative';
  if (value < 0.75) return 'Moderate-Aggressive';
  return 'Aggressive';
};
```

### State Management Pattern
All manager components follow consistent pattern:
```typescript
export function [Feature]Manager({ userId }: Props) {
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(false);
  const [editingItem, setEditingItem] = useState<Item | null>(null);

  // Load data on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    loadItems();
  }, [userId]);

  // CRUD operations
  const handleSave = async (data: Partial<Item>) => { ... };
  const handleDelete = async (id: string) => { ... };

  // Render dashboard + form modal
  return (
    <div>
      <Dashboard onAdd={...} onEdit={...} onDelete={...} />
      {showForm && <Form onSubmit={...} onCancel={...} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```
